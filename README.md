## HOMEWORK 6
Weather Dashboard

## TASK
To develop a website that would use the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities.

## CODE
The main challenge of this homework was effectively coding the Javascript to properly display the data that was required of the user. The only functionality that I missed was making sure that the 5-Day forecast displays the correct date. For some reason every day of the forecast displays the current date. The beginning of the code is setting variables to make the various AJAX calls I make later a little bit easier to create as well as read to someone not familiar with the project. 

The following code manages the search bar/button and their functionality. I then create an AJAX call to OpenWeather and then log the information that I need to the console of the page. From there, it simply takes the content necessariy both for the current weather as well as the future forecast and appends it to the cards in the html file.
